# TriviaGame

The TriviaGame is a timer based application that gives the user 30 seconds to chose an answer to the question displayed or it counts it as incorrect.

The time left for each question is displayed on the screen and at the end of the quiz the results for how the user did are displayed, and the user is met with the option to start the game over if they want to.
